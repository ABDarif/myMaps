The following **POSSIBLE extensions** are **YET-TO-BE** implemented:

* [ ] In the initial screen, show the number of places in each map along with the title.
* [ ] Instead of the default marker, use a custom marker drawable

* [ ] In the creation flow, add a button where the map will move to the userâ€™s current location.
* [ ] Add the ability to search for maps which contain a string in the title

## Notes

* [x] In the 2023.1.1 version of Android Studio (Hedgehog), if I an object with an id in the xml file, it doesn't automatically get referred to the .kt files, you have to use findViewById(). This was a major issue I faced when designing the floating Action Button for Creating Maps (fabCreatemap)
